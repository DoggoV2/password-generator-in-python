# password-generator-in-python
Epic password generator.
4 very basic (but useful) features: Generates secure passwords, option to save the generated password in password.txt, prints out all saved passwords (adding pin support very soon), you can also add an account name/service that youre signing up for, add external passwords

Dependencies: random.


ps: this is my first script so the code is messy.
